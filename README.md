# Knowlee2.0

"We believe knowledge is for everyone, and everyone has knowledge to share"

Knowlee is a social network that was created form the basic idea that there should be a free platform that allows "learners" to create sudy paths and roadmaps, 
obtain knowledge from other users and build their own profile and content to share. 
<br/>

that make it more user friendly and help the "learner" build a community. Knwolee 2.0 also improves the design and structure to follow current trends.
